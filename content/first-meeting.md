Title: First Meeting Python Leiden User Group
Date: 2024-12-17
Category: Meetings

In 2025 we'll start regular meetings for what is to be the Python Leiden User Group.
Would you like to be involved? You're invited! We're looking to host a bi-monthly meeting
on a weekday evening in Leiden, The Netherlands, where people can share their experience
with the Python programming language and learn from others.

If you write code with Python, for fun or profit, and would like to meet with peers,
please subscribe to our mailing list. We hope to announce the date and location for our first meeting soon.

If you have something cool to show, a project you built in Python, a module you maintain,
or would like to hold a small presentation, please contact me, we're looking for people
who would like to present a little something, it does not have to be big and professional)
just let us know!

We have not settled on a location yet, or on a date for the first meeting.

 - If you have tips for a great location, that can host a group for about 50 people, please let us know.
 - If you are a company and want to impress Python people with your generosity and hospitality by either
being willing to host a meeting or to sponsor us renting a conference room, please contact us!
