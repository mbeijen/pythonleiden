Date: 2024-12-17
Category: Meetings

In 2025 we'll start regular meetings for what is to be the Python Leiden User Group.
Do you want to be involved? You're invited! We're looking to host a bi-monthly meeting
on a weekday evening in Leiden, The Netherlands, where people can share their experience
with the Python programming language and learn from others.

If you write code with python, for fun or profit, and would like to meet with peers,
please subscribe to our mailing list. We hope to announce soon the date and location
for our first meeting.

If you have something cool to show, a project you built in python, a module you maintain,
or would like to hold a small presentation, please contact me, we're looking for people
who would like to present a little something, it does not have to be big and professional)
just let me know!
