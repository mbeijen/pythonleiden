# Meetup Monday, January 27, 2025

Our very first meeting! The meeting will take place from 20:00 - 22:00.

### Location

Our meeting will take place at the "[Denksportcentrum](https://www.denksportcentrumleiden.nl/)",
a venue which is the home of various mind sports clubs. Weâ€™ll be using the big room, while the
Leiden Go Club (the board game, not the programming language) will be in a smaller room. The
bar will be open before and after the meetup for drinks.

### Contents of the meeting

At this meeting, we have three talks planned:

- **Talk 1**: FawltyDeps: Finding undeclared and unused dependencies in your notebooks and projects by Johan
- **Talk 2**: How to use `uv` for dependency management by Michiel
- **Talk 3**: How I used Python in my Maths study by Tobias
