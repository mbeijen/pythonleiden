# Meetup Thursday, March 27, 2025

Our second meeting! The meeting will take place from 20:00 - 22:00. It is our first meeting
at our new location: at Technolab in Leiden, near the Lammenschans railway station
(this meeting was previously planned at Monday, March 24 at Denksportcentrum).

### Contents of the meeting

At this meeting, we have two talks planned:

- **Talk 1**: Serialization in Python by John
- **Talk 2**: How to use `uv` for dependency management by Michiel (this talk was originally planned for the first meetup but got moved over because of time constraints)
- **Talk 3**: Rendering spatial data in 3d using zarr, jax, babylon.js and DuckDB by Jesse

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion.

### Location

Our meeting will take place at the "[Technolab](https://www.technolableiden.nl/)",
a venue that offers a variety of workshops and activities for children and teenagers. We’ll be using the big meeting room, while the
people from "[The Space Leiden](https://spaceleiden.nl/)", a local hacker/makerspace, will also be present. The Space will be open starting 19:00.

This is our first meeting at the Technolab, we're really looking forward using the new facility.

#### How to get there

The Technolab is located in the building above the Plus supermarket (Bètaplein 28).
This is a 5 minute walk from the Leiden Lammenschans railway station. It’s also easily reachable by bus.

If you travel by car, the best place to park your car is at [Parking Leiden Lammenschans](https://parkingleidenlammenschans.nl/)
which is located in the basement of the building where Technolab is. Parking costs around €2 per hour.

### Price

The meetup is free of charge. Drinks are available for a small fee
