Our second meeting!

### Contents of the meeting

At this meeting, we had three talks:

- Talk 1: **Serialization in Python** including hands-on workshop by John Labelle ([link](https://www.airza.net/py))
- Talk 2: **How to use `uv` for dependency management** by Michiel Beijen ([link](https://x14.nl/uv))
- Talk 3: **Rendering spatial data in 3d using zarr, jax, babylon.js and DuckDB** by Jesse VanderWees ([link](http://topography.jessekv.com/))

Unfortunately the talks ran over time which meant there was not much time to socialize. We'll make sure
we do better next time; to make sure there is room to also get a drink and get to know your group members.

Thanks for the great meeting to all who attended and hope to see you next time!
