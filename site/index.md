# Python Leiden User Group

We're a local user group for the Python programming language based in Leiden, The Netherlands.
On our bi-monthly meetings you can exchange knowledge, learn new things and meet other Python-people.
Our meetings are free of charge and open to everyone. Our presentations and talks are in English to
be for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

## Next event
