### About our meetups

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion.
Our presentations and talks are in English to
be accessible for the large amount of non-Dutch speakers in the Python community.

### Location

Our meeting location is kindly provided by [Technolab](https://www.technolableiden.nl/), an organization that offers
science education for children and teenagers. We're very happy to be able to use their facilities.
We’ll be using the big meeting room, while the
people from "[The Space Leiden](https://spaceleiden.nl/)", a local hacker/makerspace, will also be present in the
building. The Space will be open starting 19:00.

#### How to get there

Technolab is located in the building above the Plus supermarket (Bètaplein 28).
This is a 5 minute walk from the Leiden Lammenschans railway station. It’s also easily reachable by bus.

If you travel by car, the best place to park your car is at [Parking Leiden Lammenschans](https://parkingleidenlammenschans.nl/)
which is located in the basement of the building where Technolab is. Parking costs around €2 per hour.

### Price
