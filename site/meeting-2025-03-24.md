# Meetup Monday, March 24, 2025

Our second meeting! The meeting will take place from 20:00 - 22:00.

### Contents of the meeting

At this meeting, we have two talks planned:

- **Talk 1**: Serialization in Python by John
- **Talk 2**: How to use `uv` for dependency management by Michiel (this talk was originally planned for the first meetup but got moved over because of time constraints)
- **Talk 3**: Rendering spatial data in 3d using zarr, jax, babylon.js and DuckDB by Jesse

Our talks happen in a friendly and informal setting. They are a great way to learn new things, share your knowledge, and meet other Python enthusiasts.
There is always room for questions and discussion.

### Location

Our meeting will take place at the "[Denksportcentrum](https://www.denksportcentrumleiden.nl/)",
a venue which is the home of various mind sports clubs. We’ll be using the big room. At the same
time of our meeting, a chess club will be using a smaller room. The
bar will be open before and after the meetup for drinks.

#### How to get there

The Denksportcentrum is located at Robijnstraat 4, 2332 KE Leiden. It’s easily reachable by
public transportation. Take bus line 2 from Leiden Central Station (direction: 'De Vink')
and get off at 'Opaalstraat,' which is a short walk from the venue. Alternatively, it’s less
than 10 minutes by bike from Leiden Central Station, where OV bikes are available.

In the area surrounding the Denksportcentrum, there is plenty of parking space. Until 21:00 you have
to pay for parking. After 21:00, parking is free.

### Price

We have to rent the venue. To offset these costs, we ask for a small contribution of €6 per person.
At the venue you can make the payment via Tikkie, a QR code, bank transfer or cash.
